# Notes for Hackathon Judges:
# - Ensure Python 3.11+ for compatibility with AWS Lambda, SageMaker, and Greengrass runtimes.
# - Install dependencies in a virtual environment (venv) to avoid conflicts.
# - Secure credentials (AWS, KMS, IoT) must be configured via .env (see deployment/.env.example).
# - hyperledger-fabric-sdk-py requires AWS Managed Blockchain setup; see fabric_bridge.py and aws_deploy.yaml.
# - Encrypted files (*.enc) are protected with Kyber/Dilithium (kyber.py, dilithium.py) and require KMS access.
# - Contact Jamie Terpening for secure admin credentials and setup assistance (see README.md).
```

### What and Why
- **Clarity and Structure**:
  - Added detailed docstring and inline comments explaining the package configuration and its alignment with hackathon requirements.
  - Organized `install_requires` into categories (Core, Mesh & AI, PQC/ZKP, Visualization/UI, AWS AI, Human Rights & Audit) for clarity.
  - Updated `long_description` to reference `README.md` directly and ensured UTF-8 encoding for compatibility.
  - Added `project_urls` for documentation, source, and bug tracker to improve accessibility for judges.
- **Secure Config**:
  - Pinned dependencies to specific, secure versions (e.g., `boto3>=1.34.162,<2.0.0`) to avoid vulnerabilities, aligning with `requirements.txt` and ensuring stability as of May 2025.
  - Removed `hyperledger-fabric-sdk-py` due to setup complexity and replaced it with a note about AWS Managed Blockchain (`fabric_bridge.py`, `aws_deploy.yaml`), reducing deployment risks.
  - Added `pysnark` and `helibpy` to support ZKP and homomorphic encryption (`zkp.py`, `helib_wrapper.py`), ensuring quantum-secure features.
  - Protected sensitive data by including `*.enc` in `package_data` and noting that encrypted files require KMS access (`admin_creds.enc`, `aws_deploy.yaml`).
  - Ensured `author_email` is a placeholder and referenced secure contact instructions in `README.md` and `LICENSE`.
- **Performance**:
  - Optimized dependency versions for minimal overhead in AWS Lambda, Greengrass, and SageMaker (e.g., `Flask>=3.0.3`, `gunicorn>=23.0.0`).
  - Added `fastapi` for high-performance APIs (`user_api/`, `ngo_api.py`), complementing Flask for scalability.
  - Ensured `torch` is pinned to a stable version (`>=2.4.1`) to support AI workloads (`bedrock.py`, `anomaly_gnn.py`) without excessive resource demands.
  - Set `zip_safe=False` to avoid issues with file-based resources (e.g., `.yaml`, `.enc`) in AWS environments.
- **Synergy**: Aligned with system components and files:
  - **Core** (`Flask`, `boto3`, `PyYAML`, `cryptography`): Support APIs and AWS integrations (`ngo_api.py`, `admin_api/`, `aws_deploy.yaml`, `mesh_settings.yaml`).
  - **Mesh & AI** (`websockets`, `scipy`, `torch`, `networkx`, `fastapi`): Enable trust graphs, AI models, and real-time UI (`trust_market.py`, `bedrock.py`, `time_machine.py`, `anomaly_gnn.py`).
  - **PQC/ZKP** (`pyasn1`, `pycryptodome`, `pyzmq`, `pysnark`, `helibpy`): Support quantum-secure cryptography and proofs (`kyber.py`, `dilithium.py`, `zkp.py`, `helib_wrapper.py`).
  - **Visualization/UI** (`plotly`, `dash`): Power Nexus Console dashboards (`time_machine.py`).
  - **AWS AI** (`sagemaker`, `awscli`): Facilitate model training and deployment (`bedrock.py`, `deploy_utils.py`).
  - **Human Rights & Audit** (`cbor2`, `requests`): Support whistleblower reports and logging (`lighthouse.py`, `human_rights_monitor.py`, `qldb_logger.py`).
  - Aligned with `requirements.txt`, `aws_deploy.yaml`, `deploy_utils.py`, and documentation (`README.md`, `WHITEPAPER.md`, `API_REFERENCE.md`).
- **Error Handling**:
  - Added version constraints (e.g., `<2.0.0`) to prevent breaking changes and ensure compatibility with Python 3.11+.
  - Specified `python_requires=">=3.10, <3.12"` to match AWS Lambda and SageMaker runtimes.
  - Excluded `tests` from `find_packages` to avoid installing test code in production.
  - Added notes for judges on setup requirements (Python 3.11+, virtual environment, KMS access) to prevent installation issues.
- **Advanced Integration**:
  - Added `fastapi` to support high-performance APIs, complementing Flask for scalability (`API_REFERENCE.md`).
  - Included `cbor2` for efficient serialization, aligning with `lighthouse.py`, `mesh_node.py`, and `deploy_utils.py`.
  - Added `pysnark` and `helibpy` to ensure ZKP and homomorphic encryption support, critical for `zkp.py` and `helib_wrapper.py`.
  - Updated `entry_points` to include `deploy-connection` for `deploy_utils.py`, enhancing deployment usability.
  - Ensured `package_data` includes `.yaml`, `.md`, `.json`, and `.enc` files to support configurations and encrypted secrets (`mesh_settings.yaml`, `admin_creds.enc`).
  - Added `classifiers` for additional operating systems (MacOS, Windows) to broaden compatibility, while keeping Linux as primary for AWS deployments.

### Notes
- **Dependency Alignment**: The `install_requires` list is harmonized with `requirements.txt` to avoid conflicts, adding `fastapi`, `pysnark`, `helibpy`, and `cbor2` to support new features. The omission of `hyperledger-fabric-sdk-py` is intentional due to its complexity; AWS Managed Blockchain is used instead (`fabric_bridge.py`).
- **Sensitive Data**: The `author_email` is a placeholder, and judges should refer to secure contact instructions in `README.md` and `LICENSE`. Ensure `.env` is configured with AWS credentials and KMS key IDs (`aws_deploy.yaml`).
- **Hackathon Compliance**: The license is referenced as "Custom (see LICENSE file)" to align with the restricted open-source access specified in `LICENSE`, `README.md`, and `WHITEPAPER.md`.
- **File Paths**: The script assumes `README.md` is in the root directory and `admin_core/admin_console/app.py` exists for the `connection-byjamie` entry point. Adjust if your structure differs.
