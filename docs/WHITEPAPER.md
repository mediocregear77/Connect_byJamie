## Abstract

Connection byJamie is the world’s first **fully self-proving, quantum-secure, user-governed mesh network and digital civilization**, designed for the **AWS Breaking Barriers Hackathon 2025**. It integrates **AWS generative AI** (SageMaker, Bedrock) with **post-quantum cryptography (PQC)**, **zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs)**, **real-time attestation**, and a **radical user-sovereignty paradigm** to create a decentralized, transparent, and resilient platform. Every action, component, and admin is cryptographically accountable, self-healing, and auditable, ensuring no silent compromise, subversion, or co-option is possible.

## 1. Vision

Connection byJamie redefines trust, privacy, and agency for the digital age. Unlike traditional systems that rely on centralized corporations, governments, or admins, it operates as a **living constitution**: a cryptographic, distributed, self-auditing mesh where **user sovereignty** and **privacy** are enforced by code, not promises. It empowers communities to govern themselves, defend human rights, and maintain transparency in the face of quantum threats, mega-disasters, and insider attacks.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Core Layers

- **Mesh Core** (`mesh_core/mesh_node`): Resilient, multi-radio nodes (phones, IoT, drones) connected via LoRa, BLE, Shortwave, and Satellite, auto-forming trust graphs (`mesh_settings.yaml`). Supports dynamic routing and consensus (`mesh_node.py`).
- **Cloud Core** (`deployment/`): AWS IoT, Greengrass, Lambda, Kinesis, and Hyperledger Fabric manage node orchestration, beacon aggregation, and continuity under failure, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance.
- **AI Core** (`ai_core/bedrock`): Cognitive Seed for edge AI (`bedrock.py`), Bedrock models for cloud inference, Harmony Index for network health, anomaly detection (`anomaly_gnn.py`), mesh law enforcement (`mesh_law.py`), and playbook synthesis (`playbook_synth.py`), all configured via `ai_config.yaml` and `law_params.yaml`.
- **Security Core** (`security_core/`): Post-quantum cryptography (Kyber for encryption, Dilithium for signatures: `kyber.py`, `dilithium.py`), zk-SNARKs for privacy (`zkp.py`, `verifier.py`), TPM-based attestation (`tpm_attest.py`), and homomorphic encryption for sensitive data (`helib_wrapper.py`).
- **Audit Core** (`audit_core/`): Real-time logging to AWS QLDB (`qldb_logger.py`), Hyperledger Fabric (`fabric_bridge.py`), Merkle trees (`merkle_tools.py`), and Time Machine for forensic replay (`time_machine.py`), with public feeds (`public_feed.py`).
- **Human Rights Core** (`human_rights/`): Lighthouse Mode for anonymous whistleblower reports (`lighthouse.py`, `onion_router.py`), verifiable witness statements (`witness_statement.py`, `human_rights_monitor.py`), and NGO APIs (`ngo_api.py`, `witness_verifier.py`).

### 2.2 Truth Beacon Protocol

The **Truth Beacon Protocol** is the network’s cryptographic backbone, ensuring every component is accountable:
- **Beacons**: Nodes, microservices, admins, and AI models emit **PQC-signed** (Dilithium: `dilithium.py`) and **zk-SNARK-attested** (zk-SNARKs: `zkp.py`) integrity proofs, including code/data hashes, compliance proofs, and attestation receipts (`tpm_attest.py`).
- **Trust Graphs**: Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and cross-validation isolate untrustworthy components instantly (`mesh_settings.yaml`, `law_params.yaml`).
- **Public Verification**: Beacons and events are hashed to Hyperledger Fabric (`fabric_bridge.py`), logged to QLDB (`qldb_logger.py`), and published to S3 feeds (`public_feed.py`) with Merkle proofs (`merkle_tools.py`).

### 2.3 Impossible Scenario Resilience

Connection byJamie is engineered to withstand and **prove survival** under extreme scenarios:
- **Silent Compromise**: State-level, stealthy cloud/service infiltration is detected via beacon anomalies (`anomaly_gnn.py`) and zk-SNARK failures (`zkp.py`).
- **Spectral Distortion Attack**: Radio manipulation or AI poisoning triggers immediate quarantine (`playbook_synth.py`) and rollback to last known-good state (`bedrock.py`).
- **Mega-Disaster**: 80% node loss is mitigated by drone relays, self-healing islands, and fallback radios (LoRa, Shortwave, Satellite: `mesh_settings.yaml`).
- **Insider/Rogue Admin**: Admin actions require homomorphic encryption (`helib_wrapper.py`) and multi-signature attestation (`tpm_attest.py`), with instant public alerts (`public_feed.py`).
- **AI Data Poisoning**: Malicious federated learning is countered by differential privacy and anomaly detection (`ai_config.yaml`, `anomaly_gnn.py`).
Each scenario generates **cryptographic evidence**, enabling forensic replay (`time_machine.py`) and public auditability.

## 3. User Agency & Governance

- **Mesh Democratization**: Users propose and vote on **micro-playbooks** (`playbook_synth.py`), influence routing, and shape network healing, with PBFT consensus ensuring resilience (`mesh_settings.yaml`, `law_params.yaml`).
- **Community Law**: Local constitutions are codified and enforced by Cognitive Seeds, attested by beacons, and subject to global ethical checks (`mesh_law.py`, `law_params.yaml`).
- **Lighthouse Mode**: Anonymous human rights violation reports are onion-routed (`onion_router.py`), verified (`witness_statement.py`, `human_rights_monitor.py`), and relayed to trusted NGOs (`ngo_api.py`) with cryptographic non-repudiation (`kyber.py`, `dilithium.py`).
- **Decentralized Trust Reputation**: Nodes and users earn **trust scores** based on beacon reliability, playbook contributions, and mesh health (`trust_market.py`, `ai_config.yaml`).
- **No Central Admin**: Admin actions are cryptographically enforced, auditable, and flagged if abused, using homomorphic encryption and zk-SNARKs (`helib_wrapper.py`, `zkp.py`).

## 4. Security & Privacy Model

- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Kyber for encryption and Dilithium for signatures (`kyber.py`, `dilithium.py`) ensure quantum resilience, with HSM/TPM attestation (`tpm_attest.py`) for all components.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Beacons, data aggregation, privacy compliance, and admin actions use zk-SNARKs (`zkp.py`, `verifier.py`) to prove integrity without revealing sensitive data.
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Aggregate queries on encrypted data (`helib_wrapper.py`) ensure no raw data exposure, supporting GDPR/CCPA compliance (`law_params.yaml`).
- **Immutable Logging**: Events are recorded to QLDB (`qldb_logger.py`), Hyperledger Fabric (`fabric_bridge.py`), and Merkle trees (`merkle_tools.py`), publicly verifiable via S3 feeds (`public_feed.py`).
- **Self-Healing Trust**: Anomalies trigger instant quarantine and rollback to a signed, known-good state (`playbook_synth.py`, `bedrock.py`).
- **User Notifications**: Users receive immediate, plain-language alerts with zk-SNARK receipts and links to public audit feeds (`public_feed.py`, `time_machine.py`).
